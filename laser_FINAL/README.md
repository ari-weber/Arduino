# Cat Laser Toy

 built this toy using and Arduino, a laser diode, two servo motors, and a joystick. The two servo motors give it biaxial motion, allowing control of the X and Y coordinates of the laser. The range of motion is adjustable in the code, to account for distance from the target surface. The laser moves to random coordinates, unless Joystick Mode is enabled. There is a button to enable joystick mode, and as long as it is being held, the laser willm be controlled by the attatched joystick. The Arduino circuit diagram can be found at:
